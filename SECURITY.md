## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
- **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy TaskForge behind HTTPS
- **Secure Secrets**: Store API keys and secrets securely
- **Regular Updates**: Keep TaskForge and dependencies updated
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation

#### Configuration Security
```json
{
  "security": {
    "secret_key": "use-a-long-random-secret-key-in-production",
    "password_min_length": 8,
    "session_timeout": 3600,
    "max_login_attempts": 5,
    "require_2fa": true
  },
  "cors": {
    "allow_origins": ["https://yourdomain.com"],
    "allow_credentials": true,
    "expose_headers": ["X-Total-Count"]
  },
  "rate_limiting": {
    "enabled": true,
    "requests_per_minute": 60,
    "requests_per_hour": 1000
  }
}
```

#### Database Security
- **Connection Security**: Use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
- **Least Privilege**: Use database users with minimal required permissions
- **Regular Backups**: Implement encrypted backup strategies
- **Access Monitoring**: Monitor database access and queries

### For Developers

#### Secure Development Practices
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive security logging
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

#### Code Security Guidelines
```python
# Good: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
async def get_tasks_by_user(self, user_id: str) -> List[Task]:
    query = "SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE user_id = $1"
    rows = await self.db.fetch_all(query, user_id)
    return [Task.from_row(row) for row in rows]

# Good: Input validation
def create_task(self, task_data: TaskCreateRequest) -> Task:
    # Validate input
    if len(task_data.title) > 500:
        raise ValueError("Task title too long")
    
    # Sanitize HTML content
    task_data.description = sanitize_html(task_data.description)
    
    return Task(**task_data.dict())

# Good: Secure password handling
from passlib.context import CryptContext

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    return pwd_context.hash(password)

def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)
```

#### Security Testing
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like `bandit` for security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security assessments
- **Fuzzing**: Use fuzzing tools to discover input validation issues

### For Administrators

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Keep Docker images updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups and test restoration procedures
- **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents

#### Monitoring and Alerting
```python
# Security event logging example
import logging

security_logger = logging.getLogger('taskforge.security')

def log_security_event(event_type: str, user_id: str, details: dict):
    security_logger.warning(
        f"Security event: {event_type}",
        extra={
            'user_id': user_id,
            'event_type': event_type,
            'details': details,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
    )

# Usage
log_security_event(
    'failed_login_attempt',
    user_id='unknown',
    details={'ip_address': '192.168.1.1', 'attempts': 3}
)
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT Token Security**: Tokens are signed but not encrypted
- **Session Management**: Sessions expire after configurable timeout
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have configurable rate limits
- **CORS Policy**: Cross-origin requests require explicit configuration

### Data Protection
- **Data at Rest**: Database encryption depends on your database configuration
- **Data in Transit**: HTTPS encryption for API communication
- **Logging**: Sensitive data is filtered from application logs
- **Audit Trail**: All significant actions are logged for audit purposes

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Plugin Security**: Plugins run in the same process space
- **API Keys**: External service credentials stored encrypted
- **Webhook Security**: Incoming webhooks require signature verification
- **OAuth Flow**: Secure OAuth implementation for service integrations
